## Usage

_Make sure to reload the page after installing the extension._

To generate buttons, click on the extension icon while on a zyBooks page. Blue buttons labelled 'Skip Section' should

The orange checkmarks may take a long time to show up after the answers are entered. Do not exit or reload the page 
before they all appear.
